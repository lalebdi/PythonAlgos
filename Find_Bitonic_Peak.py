Problem:
 Given an array that is bitonically sorted,
  an array that starts off with increasing terms and then concludes with decreasing terms.
   In any such sequence, there is a "peak" element, that is, the element in the sequence that is the largest element.
     find the peak element of a bitonic sequence.
