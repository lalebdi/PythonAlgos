Problem:
 Given a sorted array and a target number. Our goal is to find a number in the array that is closest to the target number.
  We will be making use of binary search to solve this problem.

The array may contain duplicate values and negative numbers.

Example 1:
    Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9}
    Target number = 11
    Output : 9
    9 is closest to 11 in given array

Example 2:
    Input :arr[] = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9};
    Target number = 4
    Output : 5
"""

arr1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9]
target_number1 = 11

arr2 = [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]
target_number2 = 4
