Problem:
 An array is "cyclically sorted" if it is possible to cyclically shift
its entries so that it becomes sorted.
The following list is an example of a cyclically sorted array:

    A = [4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3]

Write a function that determines the index of the smallest element
of the cyclically sorted array.

ARR = [4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3]
